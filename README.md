# **Whispers in the Shadows**

Introduction:<br>
You find yourself standing at the entrance of Ravenscroft Manor, an imposing mansion with a history steeped in mystery and darkness. The air is thick with an otherworldly fog, and the moonlight struggles to penetrate the dense canopy of ancient trees surrounding the estate. The only sound is a haunting whisper that seems to echo through the shadows.

Background:<br>
Ravenscroft Manor was once a grand residence, home to the enigmatic Ravenscroft family. However, a curse befell the family, and the once-majestic mansion became a place of despair and supernatural phenomena. Whispers of forbidden rituals and ghostly apparitions have haunted the halls for generations.

Inciting Incident:<br>
Driven by an insatiable curiosity or a need to uncover family secrets, you enter the mansion. As you explore, you discover an old tome hidden in the library containing an incantation that, once spoken, awakens the spirits that dwell within. The mansion transforms into a realm where the living and the dead coexist, and you are caught in the middle.

Objective:<br>
You must navigate the haunted mansion, making choices that will determine your fate. Each question presents a new challenge, a new encounter with the supernatural. The whispers guide you, but can they be trusted? Will you escape the clutches of the malevolent spirits, or will you become one with the shadows that linger in Ravenscroft Manor?

Try you luck! Welcome to <a href="https://pp3-shadows-99906bed5dee.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whispers in the Shadows</a>

    2.<br>
    ![Long lines](assets/testing-image/errors.jpg)
    3.<br>
    ![Broken While](assets/testing-image/Whilebroke.jpg)<br>

* ### Resolved

  * Whit the broken loop i hade forgotten a letter, when i put it in all worked fine.

  * With the lines. I checked the spelling and sorted out so the line get over 79.
