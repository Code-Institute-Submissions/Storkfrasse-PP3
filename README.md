## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
      Whispers in the Shadows has a simple DOS-looking design.
      * I used green color for the right answer.
      * I used red color for the wrong answer and the heading for the program name.
      * I used yellow color for the border.

# Deployment

### **To deploy the project**
The site was deployed to Heroku pages. The steps to deploy a site are as follows:
  1. On the Heroku page, click on **New**, then create a new app.
  ![Heroku page create new app](assets/readme-image/createnew.jpg)<br>
  2. Then a new window will pop up. Create a name for the deployment, and change location (Europe in my case).<br>
  ![Heroku New app](assets/readme-image/setupname.jpg)<br>
  3. Then click **Create app**.
  4. Once it's created, you will be sent to the page for deployment.
  5. In the deployment page, you will go to **Settings**.
  6. Once in Settings, you will need to add Vars (If you need.). Then you need to **Add buildpack** and add Heroku/python and Heroku/nodejs.<br>
  ![Heroku settings](assets/readme-image/settings.jpg)<br>
  7. Back to deployment. You want to use deployment method **GitHub** and connect to your repository. And search for your project.
  8. At last, you can use manual deploy and click **Deploy Branch**.<br>
